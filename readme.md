I have created sentiment analysis project where my model analyses whether a restaurant review is positive or negative.
It is an end to end NLP project.
First I have created an ipynb file where I am preprocessing (data cleaning, stemming, vectorization) the data and then training the model using Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier.
Then I have stored the model and vectorizer in pkl files and made app.py using streamlit .
On this website, you can enter a restaurant review and the model will try to accurately predict whether the review is positive or negative.
